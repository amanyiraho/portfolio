## dhis2r 0.3.0

* Updated the package to fail gracefully with an informative message if the resource is not available or has changed and doesn't give a check warning nor error

* Now API calls function print a massage "No internet connection!" if there is no internet connection instead of an error

* The url is of the queried API endpoint is printed using `message()` instead of `print()`
